# Pensieve AR

Location based AR Social Media app displayed geo-tagged images in Artificial Reality 

Users can upload Photo / Video Memories, tag them to locations, and other users that visit the location can see those memories in AR!

Alternatively, users can turn on Instagram Mode which pulls down images geotagged to your exact location and displays a gallery of images around you in Artificial Reality that were posted around you.
